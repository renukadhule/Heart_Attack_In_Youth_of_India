# Heart Attack Risk Analysis in Young People in India

## Project Overview
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the risk factors influencing heart attacks in young people (ages 18-35) in India. The dataset encompasses demographic, lifestyle, medical, and clinical test information, allowing for a deeper exploration of connections between various factors and heart attack risks.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Region, Socioeconomic Status, Urban/Rural.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, Drinking, Diet, Exercise, Screen Time, Sleep.
- **Health History**: Family Heart Disease, Diabetes, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, BMI, Stress.
- **Medical Test Results**: Heart Rate, ECG, Chest Pain, Oxygen Levels, Triglycerides.
- **Heart Attack Likelihood**: "Yes" or "No" indicating whether the individual had a heart attack.<br><br>

## Technologies Used
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Tools**: Excel

## KPIs and Analysis
**Prevalence Rate**: Percentage of young people who had a heart attack.<br>
**Prevalence Rate**: The percentage of the population at risk of heart attacks.<br>
**Smoker Heart Attack Rate**: The correlation between smoking and the likelihood of heart attacks.<br>
**Heart Attack Rate by Gender**: Distribution of heart attack risks across different genders.<br>
**Cholesterol Level by Age Group**: Analysis of cholesterol levels across various age ranges (18-35).<br>

## Recommendations
**Exercise More**: Encourage regular exercise, especially for those who don't move much.<br>
**Eat Healthy**: Promote vegetarian or vegan diets to reduce the risk of heart problems.<br>
**Check Health Regularly**: Keep track of cholesterol levels and ECG for early signs of risk.<br>
**Stop Smoking**: Work on reducing smoking among young people.<br>
**Support Healthy Living**: Make healthy food and fitness options easier for everyone.<br>

## Conclusion:
Around 20.38% of young people in India (ages 18-35) are at risk of heart attacks. Smoking, lack of physical activity, and poor diet (especially non-vegetarian) are major contributors to this risk. Men have a slightly higher risk than women. Abnormal ECG results and high cholesterol are also linked to increased heart attack risk.
